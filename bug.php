This code snippet demonstrates a potential issue in PHP related to how it handles array keys.  If you attempt to access an array element using a key that doesn't exist, PHP won't throw an error, it will simply return NULL. This can lead to unexpected behavior, especially if you're not checking for the key's existence.

```php
<?php
$myArray = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2];

echo $myArray['c']; // Outputs nothing, no error

// A safer approach is to check if the key exists before accessing it:

if (array_key_exists('c', $myArray)) {
    echo $myArray['c'];
} else {
    echo 'Key not found!';
}
?>
```
